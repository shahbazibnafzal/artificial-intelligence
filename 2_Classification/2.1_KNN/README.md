# K - Nearest Neighbors

- A method for classifying data points based on their similarity to other cases.
- Cases that are near each other are said to be neighbors.
- Based on similar cases with same class labels are near each other.
- Euclidean distance is a common metric used to measure how "close" or "similar" two points are in the feature space.

```math
The Euclidean distance between two points \( A \) and \( B \) in an \( n \)-dimensional space is given by:

\[
\text{distance}(A, B) = \sqrt{(A_1 - B_1)^2 + (A_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (A_n - B_n)^2}
\]

where \( A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n) \) and \( B = (B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n) \).
