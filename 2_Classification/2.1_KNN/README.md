# K - Nearest Neighbors

- A method for classifying data points based on their similarity to other cases.
- Cases that are near each other are said to be neighbors.
- Based on similar cases with same class labels are near each other.
- Euclidean distance is a common metric used to measure how "close" or "similar" two points are in the feature space.

```math
\text{distance}(A, B) = \sqrt{(A_1 - B_1)^2 + (A_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (A_n - B_n)^2}
```
